# Read in Data
# data from https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance
insurance <- read.csv(file = file.path("insurance.csv"))

# General Summary of Insurance Data
# summary(insurance)
# Age Mean and Median look similar, so probably not skewed
# Sex - about the same males and females
# BMI - mean and median about the same so probably not skewed
# children max is 5 children min is 0 
# Charges - Min 1122 Max - 63770

```

Histogram of charges
```{r}
qplot(x = charges, data = insurance)
```
Histogram of log(charges)
```{r}
# Fix skewness with log transformation 
# Why do this beforehand? Skewness shouldn't be a probelm unless the residuals are non-normal as a result

```
Histograms of the continuous predictors, age and bmi, along with charges (both logged and not logged)
```{r}

From the generalized additive model, we see that there is a very linear trend in age and charges.  As you get older the health insurance charges increase.  We also see that health costs tend to be higher for females than males.  The charges tend to increase as body mass index increases until about 38 and then it levels off.  The charges increase as the number of children increases between 0 and 2 children, then it levels off between 2 and 3 children.  The charges increase again from 3 to 4 children and then levels off between 4 and 5 children.  As expected, the health charges are much higher for smokers than non-smokers.  Finally, the charges are highest in the northeast than any of the other regions.  The second highest is the northwest.  The southeast has the lowest health charges of all of the regions.






When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
